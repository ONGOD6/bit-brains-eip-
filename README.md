# Bit Brains — EIP Repository
## Authorship & Attribution

Author: Alex Diaz  
Developer: ONGOD

This repository is authored and maintained by Alex Diaz, with development, protocol design, and implementation led under the developer handle ONGOD.
## Overview

This repository contains the canonical Ethereum Improvement Proposal–style documents
(EIPs) for the **Bit Brains** network.

These documents define the economic, governance, and protocol-level frameworks that guide
the design, evolution, and stewardship of Bit Brains. All proposals in this repository are
intended to be read, discussed, and referenced prior to implementation.

The primary objective of this repository is clarity, coherence, and long-term stewardship
of the Bit Brains system.
