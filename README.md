# Bit Brains — EIP Repository
## Authorship & Attribution

Author: Alex Diaz  
Developer: ONGOD

This repository is authored and maintained by Alex Diaz, with development, protocol design, and implementation led under the developer handle ONGOD.
## Overview

This repository contains the canonical Ethereum Improvement Proposal–style documents
(EIPs) for the **Bit Brains** network.

These documents define the economic, governance, and protocol-level frameworks that guide
the design, evolution, and stewardship of Bit Brains. All proposals in this repository are
intended to be read, discussed, and referenced prior to implementation.
## Epoch-to-RWA Transformation

Bit Brains undergo a protocol-level transformation after the completion of the first five epochs.

During the Brain phase, assets exist in a Genesis state: minted, distributed, and observed. No external value inputs are required.
## Real World Asset Convergence

ENS provides persistent identity. Proof of Care provides real-world input.

Together, they allow Bit Brains to function as autonomous assets that evolve based on real-world activity without custodial control or surveillance.

This convergence enables long-term coordination between humans, machines, and protocols.

After Epoch Five, Brains activate as autonomous intelligent assets and issue Cerebral extensions. At this point, the protocol begins responding to real-world participation through Proof of Care.

This marks the convergence into Real World Assets (RWA).

Bit Brains do not represent ownership of off-chain property or financial claims. Instead, they are real-world–anchored assets whose behavior, rewards, and evolution are influenced by verifiable human and machine participation.

Value emerges from continuity, contribution, and belief rather than extraction or speculation.

The primary objective of this repository is clarity, coherence, and long-term stewardship
of the Bit Brains system.

## Repository Scope

### What This Repository Contains

- Informational and standards-track EIPs defining Bit Brains protocol concepts  
- Canonical economic and stewardship frameworks  
- Formal specifications for epoch mechanics, proof-of-care, and incentive alignment  
- Historical records of draft, accepted, and superseded proposals  

### What This Repository Does *Not* Contain

- Smart contract implementations  
- Reference clients or production code  
- Marketing materials or roadmap commitments  
- Investment or financial advice  

Implementation details are expected to live in separate repositories once
specifications mature.

## Current Status

This repository is in its early formation stage.

- EIP-0001 is published as a Draft informational proposal  
- Additional EIPs are being added sequentially  
- No proposal should be considered final until explicitly marked as **Accepted**

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Issues for clarification or discussion  
- Pull requests proposing new EIPs or revisions  
- Formal reviews focused on correctness, security, and coherence  

All contributors are expected to engage constructively and respect the stewardship
principles defined in **EIP-0001**.
