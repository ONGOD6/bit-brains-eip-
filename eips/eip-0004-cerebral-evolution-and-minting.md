## Abstract

This EIP defines the Cerebral NFT layer within the Bit Brains ecosystem.
Cerebrals function as the secondary participation layer following Brains,
enabling staking, reward distribution, identity representation, and
progressive evolution toward autonomous intelligence components.

This proposal establishes the structure, purpose, reward pathways, and
expansion mechanics of Cerebrals while preserving long-term sustainability,
proof-of-care incentives, and ecosystem continuity.

---

## Motivation

The Bit Brains protocol is designed to reward long-term alignment, continuity,
and constructive participation. While Brains represent the genesis and
backbone of the ecosystem, Cerebrals provide an active execution layer that
enables growth, experimentation, and scalable participation.

This EIP introduces Cerebrals to:
- Expand participation without diluting core stewardship
- Enable staking-based reward distribution
- Support identity and ENS integration
- Provide pathways toward autonomous intelligence development
- Maintain incentives for long-term proof of care

---

## Definitions

- **Brain**: The genesis NFT representing the earliest and longest-lived
  commitment to the Bit Brains ecosystem.
- **Cerebral**: An ERC-721 NFT derived from Brains or authorized expansions,
  serving as a staking and participation primitive.
- **Proof of Care**: Sustained participation, staking continuity, and
  ecosystem-aligned behavior over time.
- **Expansion Epoch**: A governance-authorized event introducing additional
  Cerebrals to support ecosystem growth.

---

## Cerebral Overview

Cerebrals are ERC-721 NFTs that represent active participation within the
Bit Brains ecosystem. They serve as the primary interface for staking,
reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence
development.

Cerebrals may be:
- Earned through Brain participation
- Minted during authorized Expansion Epochs
- Utilized for staking and reward accrual
- Evolved into higher-order components over time

---

## Genesis Cerebrals

Each Brain is entitled to mint up to two (2) Genesis Cerebrals through defined
staking and participation mechanisms.

Genesis Cerebrals represent early alignment and inherit preferential reward
pathways relative to later expansion participants, subject to proof-of-care
requirements.

---

## Expansion Cerebrals

To support ecosystem growth and broader participation, the protocol authorizes
an Expansion Epoch introducing additional Cerebrals.

### Expansion Epoch I

- **Total Cerebrals Minted**: 1,100  
- **Public Allocation**: 1,000  
- **Community Allocation**: 100  
- **Team Allocation**: 0  

Community-allocated Cerebrals are reserved exclusively for ecosystem incentives,
onboarding initiatives, contributor recognition, and community-driven growth.
They are not allocated to the team.

Expansion Cerebrals intentionally receive lower base reward pathways compared to
Genesis Cerebrals, while retaining the ability to increase reward capacity
through sustained proof of care.

---

## Reber Holder Rendered Cerebral Artifacts

Reber holders are entitled to receive a rendered Cerebral NFT representing a
symbolic and cultural linkage to the Cerebral layer of the Bit Brains ecosystem.

Rendered Cerebral artifacts:
- Are art-focused NFTs
- Include an ENS-linked subdomain identifier
- Do not confer staking rights
- Do not emit rewards
- Do not participate in governance

These artifacts exist solely as identity and cultural primitives and do not
constitute functional Cerebrals.

---

## Reward Distribution Framework

Cerebrals participate in protocol reward distribution through staking and
epoch-based mechanisms. Reward emissions are sourced from fee allocations and
epoch-defined distributions.

Base reward allocations are intentionally modest and are designed to scale
through:
- Staking duration
- Participation across multiple epochs
- Ecosystem-aligned behavior
- Proof-of-care signals

---

## Reward Pathway Hierarchy and Proof of Care

The Bit Brains protocol prioritizes continuity, stewardship, and long-term
participation over short-term extraction.

Brains represent the earliest and longest-lived commitment within the ecosystem
and serve as the foundational backbone of the protocol. As such, Brains are
granted access to the highest potential reward pathways, unlocked through
sustained proof of care, continuous participation, and alignment with ecosystem
growth.

Cerebrals form the second-order participation layer and receive meaningful and
competitive rewards. While their base reward pathways differ from those of
Brains, Cerebrals retain clear mechanisms to increase their reward capacity over
time through continued staking, participation across epochs, and constructive
contribution to the ecosystem.

This hierarchy ensures that reward distribution favors long-term alignment,
ecosystem continuity, and the development of autonomous intelligence and
supporting projects, while discouraging short-term, extractive behavior.

---

## Supply and Emissions Context

The Bit token has a maximum supply of 200,000,000 BIT.

Approximately 90,000,000 BIT may be minted across the first three epochs to
bootstrap the ecosystem. The remaining supply may be minted over time, subject
to governance, protocol activity, and proof-of-care mechanisms.

Cerebral rewards represent a component of this long-term emission strategy and
are not guaranteed, fixed, or unconditional.

---

## Security Considerations

Cerebrals introduce staking and reward mechanisms that require careful
implementation to prevent:
- Reward manipulation
- Sybil behavior
- Premature extraction

Specific safeguards, audits, and enforcement mechanisms will be addressed in
future EIPs.

---

## Governance Considerations

Changes to Cerebral issuance, reward pathways, or expansion mechanics are
subject to governance processes defined in future proposals.

This EIP establishes principles and structure without locking the protocol into
rigid or irreversible parameters.

---

## Conclusion

Cerebrals extend the Bit Brains ecosystem by enabling scalable participation,
reward alignment, and future autonomous intelligence development while
preserving the primacy of Brains as the system’s backbone.

This design ensures that growth reinforces continuity, rewards care, and
supports long-term ecosystem sustainability.
