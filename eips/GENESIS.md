# Bit Brains Genesis Parameters

This document defines the initial conditions, allocations, and launch parameters
for the Bit Brains protocol at Genesis.

Genesis parameters are not protocol invariants. They may evolve through governance,
future EIPs, or community consensus without violating the core protocol rules
defined in the EIP series.

## Genesis Overview
- Purpose of the Genesis Brain stage
- Relationship to EIP-0001, EIP-0002, EIP-0003

## Genesis Brain Supply
- Total Genesis Brains: 1,500
- Public Allocation: 1,300
- Team / Treasury Allocation: 200

## Genesis Brain Utility
- Brains as participation primitives
- Eligibility for Proof-of-Care epochs
- BIT reward eligibility

## Team & Treasury Policy
- Team brains initially locked
- Conditional partial unlock (e.g. up to 25%) for liquidity defense
- Preference for treasury funding via rewards, not principal

## Reward Routing at Genesis
- 80% participant rewards
- 20% routed to treasury
- Treasury rewards retained or deployed as emergency capital

## Transition to Cerebral Stage
- Conditions for advancement
- Staking outcomes (1 vs 2 Cerebrals)
- Treatment of team brains
- ## Brain-to-Cerebral Evolution

Each Genesis Brain is eligible to evolve into the Cerebral stage.

- All Genesis Brains receive a minimum of one (1) Cerebral.
- Genesis Brains that stake one hundred percent (100%) of earned BIT rewards
  throughout the full Brain-stage evolution receive two (2) Cerebrals.
- Genesis Brains that do not stake one hundred percent (100%) of earned rewards
  receive one (1) Cerebral.

This incentive structure is intended to reward long-term alignment without
imposing forced behavior on participants.

## Community Expansion
- Team-owned Brainiacs reserved for community distribution
- Distribution occurs **after the Cerebral stage**
- Objective: onboarding and decentralization
