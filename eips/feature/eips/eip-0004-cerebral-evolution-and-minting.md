## Abstract

This EIP defines the creation, minting, and initial lifecycle of Cerebral tokens
within the Bit Brains protocol. Cerebrals represent the post-Genesis evolutionary
state of Brains and serve as the foundational entities for higher-order coordination,
staking, and intelligence within the system.

Cerebrals are implemented as non-fungible tokens and are designed to be forward-
compatible with future protocol stages, including the emergence of Autonomous
Intelligence Tokens (AITs).

## Motivation

The Brain stage establishes participation, alignment, and economic contribution
through Proof-of-Care and epoch-based rewards. However, Brains are intentionally
limited in expressiveness and long-term agency.

The Cerebral stage introduces a durable, evolvable entity capable of representing
persistent state, composability, and future autonomy. By separating Brain mechanics
from Cerebral evolution, the protocol enables:

- Clear lifecycle progression  
- Incentivized long-term alignment  
- Modular protocol upgrades  
- Governance-controlled emergence of intelligence

## Cerebral Overview

A Cerebral is the evolutionary successor to a Genesis Brain.

Cerebrals are non-fungible protocol entities represented as ERC-721 tokens. Each
Cerebral corresponds to a specific Genesis Brain and reflects that Brain’s behavior
and alignment during the Brain stage.

Key properties of Cerebrals include:

- Persistence across protocol epochs  
- Eligibility for extended staking and coordination  
- Forward compatibility with autonomous intelligence primitives  
- Governance-controlled evolution  

At the time of minting, Cerebrals do not possess autonomous intelligence, agency,
or self-directed behavior. Autonomy and intelligence emerge only through subsequent
protocol stages defined in future EIPs.

## Relationship to Genesis and Prior EIPs

This EIP builds upon parameters and conditions defined in:

- GENESIS.md (Genesis Brain supply, allocation, and incentives)  
- EIP-0001: Economic Stewardship  
- EIP-0002: Epoch-Based Proof-of-Care  
- EIP-0003: Epoch-Based Token Distribution  

Eligibility for Cerebral minting, including one-to-one or one-to-two outcomes,
is determined by Brain-stage behavior as defined at Genesis and enforced through
protocol rules.
