EIP: 0001
Title: Economic Stewardship Framework for Bit Brains
Author: Alex Diaz
Status: Draft
Type: Informational
Created: 2025-12-21

Abstract

This EIP defines the economic stewardship principles governing the Bit Brains protocol.
The framework prioritizes public good creation, long-term alignment, and responsibility
over extraction-driven or speculative economic models.

Economic value within Bit Brains is treated as a resource to be stewarded rather than
exploited.

Motivation

Decentralized systems often fail due to misaligned incentives, short-term extraction,
and the absence of accountability over time.

Bit Brains introduces economic stewardship as a foundational principle to ensure that
economic participation remains aligned with public good outcomes, patience, and
long-term protocol health.

Principles of Economic Stewardship

1. Stewardship Over Ownership  
Economic participation implies responsibility. Control and influence are not absolute
and must be continuously earned through alignment and care.

2. Public-First Orientation  
The protocol prioritizes broad participation and public benefit over privileged access
or concentrated extraction.

3. Patience as Economic Signal  
Time is a core economic dimension. Value accrues to participants who demonstrate
sustained alignment over extended periods.

4. Alignment Over Speculation  
Economic mechanisms are designed to discourage short-term speculation and reward
long-term commitment.

5. Renewable Influence  
No economic influence is permanent. Stewardship is continuously reassessed through
participation over time.

Non-Goals

This EIP does not define:
- Token supply or issuance mechanics
- Reward formulas or yields
- Governance implementation details
- Technical enforcement mechanisms

These elements are defined in subsequent EIPs.

Rationale

By defining economic stewardship before mechanics or distribution, Bit Brains ensures
that future technical decisions remain grounded in long-term alignment and public good
creation.
