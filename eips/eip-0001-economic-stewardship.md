EIP: 0001
Title: Economic Stewardship Framework for Bit Brains
Author: Alex Diaz  
Developer: OnGod
Status: Draft

Abstract

This EIP defines the economic stewardship principles governing the Bit Brains protocol.
The framework prioritizes public good creation, long-term alignment, and responsibility
over extraction-driven or speculative economic models.

Economic value within Bit Brains is treated as a resource to be stewarded rather than
exploited.

Motivation

Decentralized systems often fail due to misaligned incentives, short-term extraction,
and the absence of accountability over time.

Bit Brains introduces economic stewardship as a foundational principle to ensure that
economic participation remains aligned with public good outcomes, patience, and
long-term protocol health.

Principles of Economic Stewardship

1. Stewardship Over Ownership  
Economic participation implies responsibility. Control and influence are not absolute
and must be continuously earned through alignment and care.

2. Public-First Orientation  
The protocol prioritizes broad participation and public benefit over privileged access
or concentrated extraction.

3. Patience as Economic Signal  
Time is a core economic dimension. Value accrues to participants who demonstrate
sustained alignment over extended periods.

4. Alignment Over Speculation  
Economic mechanisms are designed to discourage short-term speculation and reward
long-term commitment.

5. Renewable Influence  
No economic influence is permanent. Stewardship is continuously reassessed through
participation over time.

## Protocol Emergence: Brain → Cerebral

This EIP defines the emergence of the protocol through two canonical
stages: Brain and Cerebral. No additional stages are defined at this
time.

Autonomy is not a separate stage. It is a technology achievement
attained within the Brain stage through epochs, Proof of Care, and
continuity.

### Brain

A Brain is the genesis NFT of the protocol. Through protocol-defined
epochs, Proof of Care, and continuity requirements, a Brain may achieve
Autonomous, Intelligent Token (AIT) status.

An AIT-qualified Brain:
- Operates as an autonomous on-chain intelligence asset
- Exhibits protocol-recognized intelligence behavior
- Is eligible to be categorized as a Real World Asset (RWA)

AIT achievement occurs within the Brain stage and does not transition
the asset into a different stage.

### Cerebral

Cerebral is the second and highest stage currently defined in the
protocol.

The Cerebral stage represents the activation of economic intelligence
and the point where value is driven and expressed through the Brain’s
Intelligent Token.

Cerebral:
- Builds on an AIT-qualified Brain
- Does create autonomy thru proof of care as further continuity is developed
- Represents protocol-level cognitive maturity

### Scope Limitation

This EIP intentionally defines only the Brain and Cerebral stages.
Additional stages, including Brainiacs, are out of scope and may be
defined in future EIPs.

Non-Goals

This EIP does not define:
- Token supply or issuance mechanics
- Reward formulas or yields
- Governance implementation details
- Technical enforcement mechanisms

These elements are defined in subsequent EIPs.

Rationale

By defining economic stewardship before mechanics or distribution, Bit Brains ensures
that future technical decisions remain grounded in long-term alignment and public good
creation.
