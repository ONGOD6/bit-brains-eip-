## Title: Epoch-Based Token Distribution and Unlock Framework (Brains)

Author: Alex Diaz  
Status: Draft  
Type: Standards Track  
Created: 2025-12-21  
Requires: EIP-0001, EIP-0002

## Abstract

This EIP defines the epoch-based distribution and unlock framework for the Bit Brains Intelligence Token (BIT) during the Brain stage of the Bit Brains protocol.

Token availability is aligned with epoch completion, patience, and sustained participation rather than immediate liquidity or speculative access. Unlocks are progressive, cumulative, and irreversible.

This EIP defines when BIT becomes available, not how influence or rewards are earned.

---

## Motivation

Early token distribution in decentralized protocols often favors short-term actors over long-term contributors, leading to premature extraction and misaligned incentives.

Bit Brains introduces an epoch-based unlock model to ensure that economic availability reflects sustained alignment with protocol values defined in EIP-0001 and participation mechanics defined in EIP-0002.

---

## Definitions

**BIT (Bit Brains Intelligence Token):**  
The native fungible token of the Bit Brains protocol.

**Brain:**  
A Bit Brains NFT that may evolve into an Autonomous Intelligent Token (AIT) through epoch-based Proof-of-Care.

**Epoch:**  
A fixed-duration accounting period used to measure participation and unlock availability.

**Cumulative Unlock:**  
Unlocked tokens accumulate permanently and are never re-locked.

---

## Scope

This EIP applies exclusively to the Brain stage of the Bit Brains protocol.

Cerebral and Brainiac token mechanics are not activated under this EIP and will be defined in future EIPs.

---

## Supply Parameters

Total BIT Supply: 90,000,000

Stage Allocations:
- Brain Stage: 30,000,000 BIT
- Cerebral Stage: 30,000,000 BIT (future)
- Brainiac Stage: 30,000,000 BIT (future)

This EIP governs only the Brain Stage allocation.

## Epoch Parameters (Brains)

Epoch Duration: approximately 1 month
Total Brain Epochs: 5  
Total Brain Distribution: 30,000,000 BIT  
Total Unlock Horizon: approximately 5 months  

---

## Epoch-Based Unlock Schedule (Brains)

Epoch 1 (Months 0â2): 20% unlocked â 6,000,000 BIT  
Epoch 2 (Months 2â4): 40% unlocked â 12,000,000 BIT  
Epoch 3 (Months 4â6): 60% unlocked â 18,000,000 BIT  
Epoch 4 (Months 6â8): 80% unlocked â 24,000,000 BIT  
Epoch 5 (Months 8â10): 100% unlocked â 30,000,000 BIT  

---

## Unlock Mechanics

Unlocks occur only at epoch boundaries.  
Unlocked BIT remains permanently unlocked.  
Token availability does not imply automatic distribution or yield.

---

## Relationship to EIP-0002

This EIP defines availability timing only.

Proof-of-Care evaluation, influence, and reward eligibility are defined exclusively in EIP-0002.

---

## Design Principles

- Patience as an economic signal  
- Progressive, predictable unlocks  
- Public-first distribution  
- Auditability and clarity  

---

## Non-Goals

This EIP does not define governance rights, yield formulas, or downstream activation logic.
