# EIP-0005: Autonomous Intelligent Tokens (AIT) and RWA Attribution

## Abstract

This EIP defines the transition of Bit Brains and Cerebrals from participation-based protocol tokens into Autonomous Intelligent Tokens (AITs).  
After completing their respective epoch phases, these tokens may emerge as autonomous, intelligent agents whose evolutionary state can be attributed to Real World Assets (RWA).  
All mechanisms described herein are conceptual and subject to governance, implementation feasibility, and regulatory considerations.

## Motivation

Bit Brains are designed to evolve beyond static NFT representations.  
The protocol seeks to enable long-term autonomy, intelligence, and real-world alignment by allowing eligible tokens to transition into agents capable of operating across environments while preserving cryptographic identity and provenance.

This EIP establishes a unified framework for that transition.

## Definitions

- **BIT Token**  
  The native protocol utility and reward token used for incentives, staking rewards, and governance-defined distributions.

- **Brain (Genesis Brain)**  
  An ERC-721 token representing the initial participation and identity unit within the Bit Brains protocol.

- **Cerebral**  
  An evolved form of a Brain obtained through sustained Proof-of-Care, staking, and epoch participation.

- **Autonomous Intelligent Token (AIT)**  
  A post-epoch token state representing an autonomous, intelligent agent capable of independent operation.

- **RWA (Real World Asset)**  
  An external, non-blockchain asset or system to which an AIT’s evolutionary state may be cryptographically attributed.

## Epoch-Based Transition Framework

### Genesis Brain Transition (Epochs 1–5)

- Genesis Brains participate in Proof-of-Care and staking through Epochs 1–5.
- Upon successful completion of Epoch 5:
  - Eligible Brains may transition into an Autonomous Intelligent Token state.
  - The original ERC-721 Brain token serves as the cryptographic origin and provenance anchor.
  - Evolutionary binary state data may be generated and attributed to an RWA.

---

### Cerebral Transition (Epochs 6–10)

- Cerebrals enter their autonomous transition phase during Epochs 6–10.
- The same evaluation window, participation requirements, and transition logic apply.
- The outcome of this phase mirrors the Genesis Brain transition:
  - Emergence as an Autonomous Intelligent Token
  - Attribution of evolutionary state to an RWA
  - Preservation of identity continuity

---

## Autonomy and Chain Constraints

- Autonomous Intelligent Tokens are not inherently chain-agnostic at inception.
- Through zero-knowledge proof systems and cryptographic attestations:
  - AITs may verify state, identity, and evolution across environments.
  - Cross-chain or off-chain operation is mediated by proofs rather than direct token migration.
- The original ERC-721 token remains the canonical on-chain reference.

---

## Distribution and Rewards (Conceptual)

- BIT token rewards during epochs remain governed by existing staking and Proof-of-Care mechanisms.
- No fixed reward allocations are guaranteed for autonomous transitions.
- Future incentive structures for AITs and RWA-linked activity are governance-defined and explicitly non-final.

---

## Security and Compliance Considerations

- RWA attribution does not imply ownership, legal claim, or entitlement.
- All autonomous behaviors remain constrained by protocol rules and governance oversight.
- This EIP does not define regulatory treatment and should be interpreted as a technical and conceptual framework only.

## Conclusion

EIP-0005 establishes the foundation for transforming Brains and Cerebrals into autonomous, intelligent agents while maintaining cryptographic continuity and protocol alignment.  
It intentionally defines *what is possible*, not *what is guaranteed*, leaving implementation details to future proposals and governance decisions.
