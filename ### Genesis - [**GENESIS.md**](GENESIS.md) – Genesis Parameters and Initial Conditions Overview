# Bit Brains — EIP Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the canonical Ethereum Improvement Proposal–style documents
(EIPs) for the Bit Brains network.

These documents define the economic, governance, and protocol-level frameworks
that guide the design and evolution of Bit Brains. All proposals in this repository
are intended to be read, discussed, and referenced prior to implementation.

The primary objective of this repository is clarity, coherence, and long-term
stewardship of the Bit Brains system.

---

## What This Repository Contains

- Informational and standards-track EIPs defining Bit Brains protocol concepts
- Canonical economic and stewardship frameworks
- Formal specifications for epoch mechanics, proof-of-care, and incentive alignment
- Historical records of accepted, draft, and superseded proposals

The initial anchor document for this repository is **EIP-0001**, which establishes
the economic stewardship framework upon which all subsequent proposals depend.

---

## What This Repository Does Not Contain

- Smart contract implementations
- Reference clients or production code
- Marketing materials or roadmap commitments
- Investment or financial advice

Implementation details are expected to live in separate repositories once
specifications mature.

---

## Current Status

This repository is in its early formation stage.

- EIP-0001 is published as a Draft informational proposal
- Additional EIPs are expected to follow, beginning with epoch and proof-of-care mechanics
- No proposals should be considered final until explicitly marked as Accepted

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Issues for clarification or discussion
- Pull requests proposing new EIPs or revisions to existing drafts
- Formal reviews focused on correctness, security, and coherence

All contributors are expected to engage constructively and respect the
stewardship principles defined in EIP-0001.
